### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It
is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`
, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is
   executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("edit 1 n/Amy")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `edit n/Amy` Command](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `EditCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

### Add contacts with optional arguments

#### Implementation

The add mechanism is facilitated by AddCommand and AddCommandParser. It allows users to add contacts by name alone,
without the need to include contact details.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the addCommand mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user first launches Socius and adds a new contact by name, without any contact details.

2. The user executes the command "add n/[NAME]" to add a new person with no contact details.

3. The `parse` function of AddCommandParser will parse the input and set the optional arguments as empty strings, before
   instantiating a new `Person` object.

4. The command communicates with the `Model` to add the person to the existing AddressBook.

5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the AddCommand function works:

![UpdatedAddCommandSeqDiagram](images/AddCommandDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![UpdatedAddCommand](images/UpdatedAddCommand.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How contacts are saved with optional arguments:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save a contact, with empty strings as arguments if argument is not included in
  input.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May result in unexpected bugs.

* **Alternative 2:** Save all optional attributes of a contact as Optional type.
    * Pros: Will result in fewer unexpected bugs since input is expected to be optional.
    * Cons: Harder to implement.

### Adding a remark

#### Implementation

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an add remark command on a specified person:

![RemarkActivityDiagram](images/RemarkActivityDiagram.png)

The add remark mechanism will add remark to a contact specified by a given index. If a remark already exists, the new remark will overwrite the old remark.

During `RemarkCommand#execute`, a new `Person` object will be created. For all of its properties (e.g. `Name`) except for `Remark`, the values will remain the same as the original person's properties.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add remark mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `remark 1 r/She likes coding` command to add the remark field to the first person.

Step 2. `RemarkCommandParser#parse` will then parse the arguments provided. In this example, a new `RemarkCommand` object will be created after parsing.

The following sequence diagram briefly shows how the parser operation works:

![RemarkParserSequenceDiagram](images/RemarkParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 3. The `RemarkCommand` will then create a new `Person` using information from input remark. All other information will be taken from the original `Person`.

Step 4. `RemarkCommand#execute` will then replace the old `Person` in the `model` with the new `Person`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add remark mechanism works:

![RemarkSequenceDiagram](images/RemarkSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not be saved in the AddressBook, so the person inside the AddressBook will not be updated.
</div>

#### Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new person with the remark field replaced and the other fields same as the old person.
    * Pros: Maintains immutability.
    * Cons: It may have performance issues in terms of memory usage as a new `Person` object is created.

* **Alternative 2:** Edit the old person directly.
    * Pros: It uses less memory and thus may run faster.
    * Cons: If the execution is stopped halfway, then the newly updated person will contain wrong information. It will also be difficult to debug.

### Finding Persons

#### Implementation

The find mechanism is facilitated by FindCommand and FindCommandParser. It allows users to find contacts using any of their contact details.


#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the findCommand mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user first launches Socius. The user can see the details of his/her contacts once Socius starts.

2. The user finds a new contact by one or more contact details, for example, Name and Tag.

3. The user executes the command "find n/[NAME] t/[TAG]" to find people with that Name and has that Tag.

4. The `parse` function of FindCommandParse will parse the input and instantiate a new `Predicate` object for each
   argument present. At the end, all `Predicate` objects are combined using the `MultiplePredicate` object.

5. The command communicates with the `Model` to filter out the found person from the existing AddressBook.

6. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the FindCommand function works:

![UpdatedAddCommandSeqDiagram](images/FindCommandDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![UpdatedAddCommand](images/UpdatedFindCommand.png)#

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How contacts are saved with multiple arguments:**


* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include people who contain all the specified contact details
    * Pros: Intuitive feature. Similar to a Filter function in popular apps today.
    * Cons: Requires you to be familiar of the people in your contact list.

* **Alternative 2:** Include people who contain at least one of the specified contact details.
    * Pros: Good for users who want to broadly search for eligible friends
    * Cons: Not very intuitive

### Delete multiple persons

#### Implementation

The deleting multiple person mechanism will delete contacts specified by a given set of keywords. Any contacts containing **all** the specified keywords will be deleted.

It works by filtering for the contacts in the `model` and deleting them one by one.

#### Usage

The following activity diagram briefly summarizes what happens when a user executes the `DeleteMultipleCommand` to delete contacts by keywords:

![DeleteMultipleActivityDiagram](images/DeleteMultipleActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an exmaple usage scenario and how the deleting multiple person mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `deletem t/friends g/m` command to delete all contacts with the tag `friends` and gender `M`.

Step 3. This will call `DeleteMultipleCommandParser#parse` which will then parse the arguments provided.
Within `DeleteMultipleCommandParser#parse`, `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `GenderContainsKeywordsPredicate` will be created using the tags and gender. These will then be added into the list of predicates.

Step 4. A new `DeleteMultipleCommand` object will be created with its `predicate` set to the one defined in the previous step.
The following sequence diagram briefly shows how the parser operation works (`MultiplePredicates` not shown):

![DeleteMultipleParserSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteMultipleParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 5. `DeleteMultipleCommand#execute` will filter the model with the provided list of predicates and get back the filtered list.

Step 6. It will then iterate through the list and call `deletePerson` to remove contact with matching keywords one by one.

Step 7. After deleting contacts, it will call `updateFilteredPersonList` on model to list all the remaining contacts.

The following sequence diagram shows how the deleting multiple person mechanism works:

![DeleteMultipleSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteMultipleSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deletes multiple contacts from the list given multiple keywords.
    * Pros: Convenient for user to mass delete contacts with one command instead of removing one by one.
    * Cons: Challenging to implement as it requires parsing and checking multiple dynamic parameters. It also may have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Deletes multiple contacts from the list given a single keyword.
    * Pros: Less overlapping and easier to debug. It also uses less memory and thus may run faster.
    * Cons: Reduced flexibility for users when deleting contacts as they can only input one single keyword.

### Sorting persons

#### Implementation

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a sort persons command with a specified field:

![SortActivityDiagram](images/SortActivityDiagram.png)

The sort mechanism sorts persons based on the specified field in ascending order.
The command will result in the creation of a Comparator<Person>.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `sort n/` command to sort all persons by name in ascending alphabetical order.

Step 3. This will call SortCommandParser#parse which will then parse the arguments provided.

Step 4. A new `NameComparator` and `SortCommand` object will then be created. It will be used to sort all the persons based on their names. This `NameComparator` is then passed to the `SortCommand`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the parser operation works (`NameComparator` not shown):

![SortParserSequenceDiagram](images/SortParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 5. `SortCommand#execute` will set the `AddressBook` model's sorted person list with the provided comparator.

Step 6. The GUI will then proceed to get the full list of persons.

Step 7. After execution, `CommandResult` will contain a message indicating that it has sorted all persons based on the specified field.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort mechanism works:

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort all persons based on single field.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May not be very convenient if the contact list is very huge and users would like to sort based on multiple fields.

* **Alternative 2:** Sort all persons based on multiple fields.
    * Pros: Convenient if the contact list is very huge and users would like to sort based on multiple fields.
    * Cons: Difficult to implement.
    
### Viewing Statistics

#### Implementation

The Statistics command displays the nationality statistics of a given tutorial group.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Statistics mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `stat T09` command to compute the nationality statistics of tutorial group `T09`.

Step 3. This will call StatisticsCommandParser#parse which will then parse the arguments provided.

Step 4. A new `TutorialGroup` and `StatisticsCommand` object will then be created. It will be used to compute the statistics of the particular `TutorialGroup`. This `TutorialGroup` is then passed to the `StatisticsCommand`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the parser operation works (`NameComparator` not shown):

![StatisticParserSequenceDiagram](images/StatisticParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 5. `StatisticsCommand#execute` will set the `AddressBook` model's filtered person list with the filter criteria being the tutorial group. It will then be extracted into a `List` and then the `AddressBook` model's list will be reset.

Step 6. A `Statistic` object will then be created and its raw data will be passed to the returned `CommandResult`.

Step 7. The GUI will then proceed to parse the raw data and display it as a pie chart to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Statistic mechanism works:

![StatisticSequenceDiagram](images/StatisticSequenceDiagram.png)

### Import JSON file

#### Implementation

The import JSON file will import an external addressbook and add all the entries to the current addressbook in the user's device.

It works by utilizing the same mechanism that is used by Socius when first initializing the addressbook with existing JSON data.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Import mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `import t35.json` command to import a file located in `data/t35.json`.

Step 3. This will call `ImportCommandParser#parse` which will then parse the argument provided.

Step 4. A new `ImportCommand` object will be created with its `importedFileName` set to the one parsed in the previous step.

Step 5. `ImportCommand#execute` will create a mock `Storage` that takes in a mock `AddressBookStorage` with the `filePath` set to `data/importedFileName`.

Step 6. It will then call `Model#importAddressBook` which will take in the imported `ReadOnlyAddressBook` returned from `Storage#readAddressBook`.

Step 7. Finally, it will return a `CommandResult` if the operation is successful.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: File directory:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only allow to-be-imported files to be located in the `data` directory
    * Pros: Every file used in the application will live under a single `data` directory.
    * Cons: Less flexibility for the user.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow to-be-imported files to be located anywhere
    * Pros: Gives user the flexibility to put the file wherever they want.
    * Cons: Different OSes have different file paths convention.

### Support for multiple social handles

#### Implementation
A social handle can store a social platform and a user ID tied to that platform.

As a person may have multiple social handles for different social platforms, there is a need to support multiple social handles tied to a person.

The approach to implementing multiple social handles is similar to the original AB3's approach to implementing multiple tags. A Java HashSet is used to store all the social handle objects of a person. 

The current implementation allows for each person to have only 1 social handle for each platform. Therefore, when parsing social handles, new user ID will overwrite old user ID of the same social platform. This is done by using a Java Hashtable to store all the original social platforms in a platform name to social handle object pair, then check if the social platform of new social handle is present in the hashtable, and then update accordingly. After all the updates, the values of the hashtable are converted into a set to be store under an attribute of a person.

#### Usage
Social handles can be introduced to a person via the 'add' or 'edit' command.

Given a user wants to change the following entry:
![SocialHandleBeforeAfterEdit](images/dg/SocialHandleBeforeAfter.png)

Given below demonstrates how the social handle mechanism would behave at each step.

Step 1: The user enters the command `edit 1 s/tg:alex777 s/ig:a_lex_123 s/tw:alexxx00`

Step 2: `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` will be called to do the first round of parsing to find the type of command being used.

Step 3: After finding the command used is Edit, `EditCommandParser#parse` will be called to further parse the command.

Step 4: `EditCommandParser#parse` will call `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize` to get an `ArgumentMultimap` object, which contains parsed values of all the prefixes.

Step 5: `ArgumentMultimap#GetAllValues` is then called to get a list of values with social handle prefix `s/`.

Step 6: `ParserUtil#parseSocialHandles` is then used to parse the string value of social handles into a set of `SocialHandle` objects.

Step 7: `EditCommand` object is then created and updated with all the change needed to a person.

Step 8: `LogicManager` will then execute the `EditCommand`

Step 9: This will update the relevant person with the new data

The following sequence diagram shows how the EditCommand function works for social handles:
![EditCommandSeqDiagramForSocialHandle](images/dg/EditCommandDiagramForSocialHandle.png)

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How to store social handle**
* **Alternative 1:** Store each social handle for each platform as an individual attribute of a person
    * Pros: The logic will be easier to test.
	* Cons: There will be many duplicated code as each social handles are similar.
* **Alternative 2 (Current):** Store a person's social handles as a set.
    * Pros: It will be neater and less time-consuming to implement. Supporting additional platforms will only requires little code change.
    * Cons: It may be more complicated to test.

### Export JSON file

#### Implementation

The export JSON file will export all the current data into a JSON file.

It works by utilizing the same mechanism that is used by Socius when saving the addressbook into a JSON file.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Export mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `export tmp.json` command to export a file located in `data/tmp.json`.

Step 3. This will call `ExportCommandParser#parse` which will then parse the argument provided.

Step 4. A new `ExportCommand` object will be created with its `outputFilePath` set to `data/FILE_NAME`,
with the `FILE_NAME` being the string parsed in the previous step.

Step 5. `ExportCommand#execute` will first call `FileUtil#createIfMissing` to create the file as specified in `outputFilePath`.

Step 6. It will then call `JsonUtil#saveJsonFile` which will take in the `outputFilePath` and a `JsonSerializableAddressBook` of the current data, which is retrieved by calling `model#getAddressBook()`.

Step 7. Finally, it will return a `CommandResult` if the operation is successful.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: File directory:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only allow files to be exported to the `data` directory
    * Pros: Every file exported from the application will live under a single `data` directory.
    * Cons: Less flexibility for the user.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow users to export files to any directory
    * Pros: Gives user the flexibility to place the file wherever they want.
    * Cons: Different OSes have different file paths convention.

### Aliasing Commands

#### Implementation

The aliasing mechanism will give an alias to the specified command. If an alias already exists, the new command being aliased will overwrite the old one.

During `AliasCommand#execute`, a new entry of alias-command pair will be put into a singleton class called `CommandAliases`, which is implemented using a `HashMap`.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the alias mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `alias a/Singaporeans c/find nat/Singaporean` command to assign the alias `Singaporeans` to the command `find nat/Singaporean`.

Step 2. `AliasCommandParser#parse` will then parse the arguments provided. Then a new `AliasCommand` object will be created after parsing.

The following sequence diagram briefly shows how the alias operation works:

![AliasParserSequenceDiagram](images/AliasParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 3. `AliasCommand#execute` will then add a new entry of alias-command pair into `CommandAliases` by calling `CommandAliases#put`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the alias command mechanism works:

![AliasSequenceDiagram](images/AliasSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not be saved in the AddressBook, so the person inside the AddressBook will not be updated.
</div>

#### Design considerations:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Singleton pattern
    * Pros: Cannot be instantiated multiple times.
    * Cons: Might be confusing for new developers.

* **Alternative 2:** Non-Singleton
    * Pros: More commonly used in general and thus easier to understand.
    * Cons: A normal class can be instantiated multiple times, which does not suit the context of this implementation.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` â€” Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` â€” Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` â€” Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()`
and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the
initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command
calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes
to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book
state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`
, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing
the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite â€” it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such
as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`.
Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


### Input Suggestion

#### Implementation

The Input Suggestion mechanism will suggest potential words when the user types in something wrong or invalid.

Currently, this feature only supports suggestions for commands and nationalities.

This feature is implemented using the `Wagner-Fischer` dynamic programming algorithm to compute the `Levenshtein distance`.
The `Levenshtein distance` between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits
(insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Input Suggestion mechanism behaves at each step when a user types in a wrong command word.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `fin n/Ben` command, with the intention of typing `find n/Ben`.

Step 3. This will call `AddressBookParser#parseCommand`. But since there are no command words that match it,
it will end up at the `default` clause of the `switch` statement.

Step 4. A new `WordSuggestion` object will be created with its `word` set to the `commandWord`,
`validWords` set to the `COMMAND_WORDS` list, and the `distanceLimit` set to 2.

Step 5. While being initialized, `WordSuggestion#computeAllLevenshteinDistance` will be called, and it will compute the
`Levenshtein distance` of `word` with every single word in `validWords`.
The result will be stored as a `Map` in `editDistances`,
with the key and value being a word and its corresponding edit distance respectively.
the minimum edit distance is also computed and stored in `minDistance`.

Step 6. Next, `WordSuggestion#getSuggestedWords` is called. It will return as a string, all the words that has
the same edit distance as `minDistance`, if `minDistance` is smaller than `distanceLimit`.

Step 7. Finally, it will throw a `ParseException` which contains the suggested words computed previously and
display the suggestions to the user.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Algorithm and Time Complexity:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Dynamic programming (Wagner-Fischer algorithm)
    * Pros: More efficient, only takes `O(n * m)` time, with `n` and `m` being the length of each of the two strings.
    * Cons: Harder to implement by the developers.

* **Alternative 2:** Recursive
    * Pros: Very straightforward to implement as it follows directly from its mathematical formula.
    * Cons: Very inefficient as there are three recursive calls at each step, resulting in exponential time complexity.
