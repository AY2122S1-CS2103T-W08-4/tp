Welcome to Socius User Guide! 

Socius is a desktop application that can help you, as a student taking CS2103T Software Engineering, to manage your classmates’ contacts, so that you can have a easier time looking for teammates for group projects. This User Guide hopes to get you familarized with the commands of Socius and the flow of using the program so that you can get the most out of it.

We hope that you will have a great time using Socius! :)

Here are some example usages you can derive from Socius:
* Keep track of details of classmates who are also taking CS2103T
* Delete details of less acquainted classmates
* Tag classmates based on assigned project groups
* Filter classmates based on different project groups

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
Socius is optimized for use via a *Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)*. If you can
type fast, Socius can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional *GUI* apps.

## Quick Start

1. Before you can use the application, you need to have ***Java 11*** installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `Socius.jar` on our [Releases](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/releases) page.

1. Move the file (`Socius.jar`) to a folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Socius Application.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. You should see the following screen similar to the one below appear within a few seconds. (If double-click does not work, you can go to the terminal and type in `java -jar Socius.jar`. Ensure that the terminal is in the directory of the `Socius.jar` file.)

* Note that the app comes with some sample data by default. Type **`clear`** in the command box to remove those sample data.

* You can refer to the next section on [Features](#features) for more details of each command. Alternatively, you can go to [Command Summary](#command-summary) for an overview of all commands.

* The following are some example of commands you can try. Type the command in the command box and press `⤷Enter` to execute it.

    * **`list`** : Lists all contacts.

    * **`add`** `n/John Doe tg/W08 nat/Singaporean` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to Socius.

    * **`delete`** `3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

    * **`clear`** : Deletes all contacts.

    * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
