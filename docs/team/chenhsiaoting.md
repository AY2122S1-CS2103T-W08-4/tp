### Project: Socius

Socius is a simple desktop app for managing CS2103T tutorial classmatesâ€™ contacts for international students, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Socius can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Socius helps you to gather information about your CS2103T tutorial classmates and facilitate the forming of project groups with them.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the Nationality and Remark models to a Person.
  * What it does: allows a person's contact to contain nationality and a unique remark defined by the user. 
  * Justification: This feature improves the product by offering more personal details of a classmate and allows user to customise messages for his classmate based on his impression of the person.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future as it introduces new parameters to the Person class.
  * Credits: The remark model was taught in Week 6, extracted from AB-3.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete multiple contacts given any keywords.
  * What it does: allows the user to delete all contacts with matching keywords, and support matching all properties of a Person.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may want to delete multiple contacts and the app should provide a convenient way to do it all with one command.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
